# Me [(the website)](https://jbasallaje.github.io/me/)




Hi, I'm Jonathan Basallaje. This is a website about the things I'm involved which you can also see below:

I work on several projects that primarily help people use and consume text better on the web. These include
* [Writ.ink](http://www.writ.ink)
* [Ascroll.io](https://www.google.com)
* [Poetry Helper](https://www.twitter.com)

I'm also involved in exciting innovations in the healthcare space, and I have a podcast about reading more books.
