# Me [(the website)](https://jbasallaje.github.io/me/)




Hi, I'm Jonathan Basallaje.

I'm working on several projects that help people use and consume text better on the internet. These include
* [Writ.ink](writ.ink)
* [Ascroll.io](google.com)
* [Poetry Helper](twitter.com)

I'm also involved in exciting innovations in the healthcare space, and I have a podcast about reading more books.
